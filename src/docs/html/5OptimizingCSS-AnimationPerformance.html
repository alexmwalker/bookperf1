        <strong>CSS animations are known to be super performant. Although this is the case for simple animations on a few elements,
            if you didn&#39;t code your animations with performance in mind and add more complexity, website users will soon
            take notice and possibly get annoyed.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>In this article, I introduce some useful browser DevTools features that will enable you to check what happens under the
        hood when animating with CSS. This way, when an animation looks a bit choppy, you&#39;ll have a better idea why and
        what you can do to fix it.</p>
    <h2 id="developer-tools-for-css-performance-">Developer Tools for CSS Performance </h2>
    <p>Your animations need to hit 60 fps (frames per second) to run fluidly in the browser. The lower the rate, the worse your
        animation will look. This means the browser has no more than about 16 milliseconds to do its job for one frame. But
        what does it do during that time? And how would you know if your browser is keeping up with the desired framerate?</p>
    <p>I think nothing beats user experience when it comes to assessing the quality of an animation. However, developer tools
        in modern browsers, while not always 100% reliable, have been getting smarter and smarter, and there&#39;s quite
        a bit you can do to review, edit and debug your code using them.</p>
    <p>This is also true when you need to check framerate and CSS animation performance. Here&#39;s how it works.</p>
    <h2 id="exploring-the-performance-tool-in-firefox-">Exploring the Performance Tool in Firefox </h2>
    <p>In this article I use the Firefox Performance tool. The other big contender is the Chrome Performance Tool. You can pick
        your favorite, as both browsers offer powerful performance features.</p>
    <p>To open the developer tools in Firefox, choose one of these options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click on your web page and choose
            <em>Inspect Element</em> in the context menu</li>
        <li>If you use the keyboard, press Ctrl + Shift + I on Windows and Linux or Cmd + Opt + I on macOS.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next, click on the
        <em>Performance</em> tab. Here, you&#39;ll find the button that lets you start a recording of your website&#39;s performance:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494616829devtools-performance-panel.png" alt="Performance panel in Firefox Developer
Tools.">
    </p>
    <p>Press that button and wait for a few seconds or perform some action on the page. When you&#39;re done, click the
        <em>Stop Recording Performance</em>
        button:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494616877stop-recording.png" alt="Stop recording browser activity in the Performance
panel.">
    </p>
    <p>In a split second, Firefox presents you with tons of well-organized data that will help you make sense of which issues
        your code is suffering from.
    </p>
    <p>The result of a recording inside the
        <em>Performance</em> panel looks something like this:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494616916complete-recording-screenshot.png" alt="Results of the recording in the Performance
panel.">
    </p>
    <p>The
        <em>Waterfall</em> section is perfect for checking issues related to CSS transitions and keyframe animations. Other sections
        are the
        <em>Call Tree</em>
        and the
        <em>JS Flame Chart</em>, which you can use to find out about bottlenecks in your JavaScript code.</p>
    <p>The Waterfall has a summary section at the top and a detailed breakdown. In both, the data is color-coded:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow bars refer to JavaScript operations.</li>
        <li>Purple bars refer to calculating HTML elementsâ€™ CSS styles (recalculate styles) and laying out your page (layout).
            Layout operations are quite expensive for the browser to perform, so if you animate properties that involve repeated
            layouts (also known as
            <em>reflows</em> --- such as
            <code>margin</code>,
            <code>padding</code>,
            <code>top</code>,
            <code>left</code>, etc. --- the results could be janky.</li>
        <li>Green bars refer to painting your elements into one or more bitmaps (Paint). Animating properties like
            <code>color</code>,
            <code>background-color</code>,
            <code>box-shadow</code>, etc., involves costly paint operations, which could be the cause of sluggish animations and
            poor user experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also filter the type of data you want to inspect. For instance, I&#39;m interested only in CSS-related data,
        so I can deselect everything else by clicking on the filter icon at the top left of the screen:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494616970performance-panel-filter.png" alt="Filter feature inside Firefox Performance Dev
Tools.">
    </p>
    <p>The big green bar below the Waterfall summary represents information on the framerate.</p>
    <p>A healthy representation would look quite high, but most importantly, consistent --- that is, without too many deep gaps.</p>
    <p>Let&#39;s illustrate this with an example.</p>
    <h3 id="the-performance-tool-in-action">The Performance tool in action</h3>
    <p>This is a simple
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations">CSS animation
        </a>
        using the
        <code>@keyframes</code> keyword. The test page looks like this:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494617022demo-page-visible-box.png" alt="Demo page with rectangular box
visible.">
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494617057demo-page-disappearing-box.png" alt="Demo page with
rectangular box about to slide
out.">
    </p>
    <p>The rectangular purple box slides in and out of view in an infinite cycle.
    </p>
    <p>I&#39;ve done this by animating the
        <code>margin-left</code> property of the
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
        element that represents the rectangular box on the screen. Here&#39;s what the
        <code>@keyframes</code> animation block looks like:</p>
    <pre><code class="lang-css">@keyframes slide-margin { 
    100% { 
        margin-left: 0;
        } 
    }
</code></pre>
    <p>The performance data I get from this animation looks like this:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494617156slide-margin-recording.png" alt="Recording of animating with margins in Firefox Performance panel of
the developer
tools.">
    </p>
    <p>The framerate visual looks a bit jagged and the framerate is an average of 44.82 fps, which is a bit low.</p>
    <p>Also, notice all the layout and paint operations that take place during the animation. These are costly operations the
        browser performs on its main thread, which has a negative impact on performance.</p>
    <p>Finally, if you access the
        <em>Inspector</em> tool, click in the
        <em>Animation</em>
        section and hover over the animation name, an information box pops up with all the relevant data about the current animation.
        If your animation were optimized, there would be a message stating the fact. In this case, there is no message:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494617204animation-panel-nonoptimized.png" alt="Animation panel inside the Inspector tool with info about the current
animation.">
    </p>
    <p>Now, I&#39;m going to change my code and make a new recording as the browser animates the CSS
        <code>translate3d()</code> property using this
        <code>@keyframes</code> block:</p>
    <pre><code class="lang-css">@keyframes slide-three-d { 
    100% { transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); 
    } 
}
</code></pre>
    <p>This is what the recording of the performance looks like:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494617268translate-recording.png" alt="Recording of animation done using
translate3d.">
    </p>
    <p>Now the framerate is higher (56.83 fps) and the waterfall is showing no costly layout and paint operations.</p>
    <p>Also, if you open the
        <em>Inspector</em> tab of the developer tools, access the
        <em>Animation</em> panel and hover the mouse over the name of the animation, you can see something like this:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="../images/1494617317animation-panel.png" alt="Animation panel in the Inspector of Firefox Developer
Tools.">
    </p>
    <p>The info box relative to the animation name states that all animations are optimized, which is good news for your website
        visitors.</p>
    <h2 id="only-animate-css-opacity-transforms-and-filters-">Only Animate CSS
        <em>Opacity</em>,
        <em>Transforms</em> and
        <em>Filters</em>
    </h2>
    <p>You&#39;ve probably heard this piece of advice before, but just in case, it&#39;s worth going over it again: if you want
        your animations to run smoothly, animate only CSS opacity, transforms and filters. Animating everything else will
        put your browser under pressure to perform costly tasks in very little time, which often doesn&#39;t yield the best
        results.</p>
    <p>As the Performance tool in your browser confirms, repeated layout and paint operations are not your friend.</p>
    <p>However, each browser handles CSS properties a bit differently. If you want to know exactly which browser triggers layout
        and paint operations for which properties (especially when updating values for those properties, which is what is
        involved in web animation), head over to
        <a href="https://csstriggers.com/">CSS Triggers</a>.</p>
    <p>To ensure performant animations, a popular approach is to force the browser to hand over the work of changing some properties
        to the GPU (Graphical Processing Unit), which relieves the browser&#39;s main thread of some pressure and takes advantage
        of hardware acceleration. You can do so by using the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/will-change">
            <code>will-change</code> CSS property
        </a>, or the
        <code>translateZ(0)</code> and
        <code>translate3d(0,0,0)</code> hacks. All of these tricks will work, but if you overdo it you could actually get exactly
        what you&#39;re trying to avoid, i.e., janky animations.</p>
    <p>I&#39;m not going into the details of hardware acceleration for web animation performance, but if you&#39;d like to dig
        deeper, take a look at the resources listed below.</p>
